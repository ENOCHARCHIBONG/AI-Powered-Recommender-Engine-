**AI-Powered Recommender Engine for University Courses**.
**Problem**:  After secondary school education, most students seeking admission into the university choose their courses out of their parent’s wishes or out of peer pressure. Some choose courses randomly because they are not sure of what to study. This knowledge showcase focuses on a Machine Learning solution to these problems using AI. 
**The Goal**: To build a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System that suggests degree programs and Universities to students seeking admission based on choices of similar students. The machine considered student’s interest, peer pressure and parental influence.
**Features of the Project**
✅ Student enters their interests (e.g. Engineering, Law, or Mathematics), parental choice or peer choice
✅ Then AI will recommend programs or courses for them. It will also recommend the universities that match their choice.
✅ The AI will also give reason “why” the course is recommended (e.g., interest similarity, peer match, career trend).
**Tools Needed**
	Dataset
	Python (Jupyter Notebook)
	AI (ChatGPT)
